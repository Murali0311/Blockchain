# NFT Staking Platform

## Overview
This project is a smart contract implementation of an NFT Staking Platform, where users can stake their NFTs and earn rewards in the form of ERC20 tokens. The platform includes mechanisms for unbonding time and reward delay time to ensure fair and secure reward distribution.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following main components:

1. **Smart Contracts:**
   - `StakingContract.sol`: The main contract that manages staking, unstaking, and rewards.
   - `IERC721.sol`: Interface for the ERC721 standard, representing the NFTs that can be staked.
   - `IERC20.sol`: Interface for the ERC20 standard, representing the reward tokens.

2. **Deployment:**
   - A deployment script using Hardhat to deploy the `StakingContract` contract with specific parameters such as owner address, NFT contract address, reward token address, reward rate, unbonding time, and reward delay time.

## Key Features
- **Stake NFTs:** Users can stake their NFTs to start earning rewards.
- **Unstaking:** Allows users to unstake their NFTs after a specified unbonding period.
- **Claim Rewards:** Users can claim their accumulated rewards after a delay period.
- **Admin Functions:** The contract includes functionalities for pausing/unpausing the staking process and updating reward rates, controlled by the owner.

## Installation
To set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables if necessary.

## Deployment
The `StakingContract` contract can be deployed using the provided deployment script. Make sure to specify the correct addresses and parameters for the deployment.

## Testing
Basic tests are included to ensure the functionality of the staking and reward system. You can run the tests using:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```
